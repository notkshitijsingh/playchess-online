### Key Components

- **`game.html`**: Front-end UI for the chessboard, move history, and player info.
- **`style.css`**: Styles for game layout and components.
- **`game.js`**: Core game logic, turn switching, move tracking, and player timer management.
- **`server.js`**: WebSocket setup for real-time communication between players.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/playchess-online.git
   cd playchess-online
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Server**:
   ```bash
   node server/server.js
   ```

4. **Access the Game**:
   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000/game.html`.

## How to Play

1. **Create a Room**: 
   Launch the game and create a new room. Share the link with other players.

2. **Join a Room**: 
   Use the shared room link to join an existing game.

3. **Start Playing**:
   - Players are assigned as white or black.
   - The timer starts automatically for the player with the first turn.
   - Moves are displayed in real-time, with separate move lists for each color.

## Game Mechanics

- **Player Turns**: The player’s timer only runs on their turn, switching automatically after each valid move.
- **Timer Switching Logic**:
   - When a move is completed, the active timer stops and switches to the other player.
- **Move Tracking**: All moves are stored and displayed in separate lists for white and black pieces.
  
## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, WebSocket
- **Libraries**:
  - `chessboard.js` for board rendering
  - `chess.js` for move validation and game rules

## Future Enhancements

- **Player Chat**: Add an in-game chat for player communication.
- **Spectator Mode**: Allow additional users to watch ongoing games.
- **Scoreboard**: Track and display game wins/losses for registered players.
- **AI Opponent**: Provide a single-player mode with an AI opponent.
